Odin Project -> JavaScript Course -> Testing JavaScript -> Project: Battleship

An implementation of the classic Battleship game that supports a single player playing against the computer. This project demonstrates general proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as unit testing with Jest.

### Rainy Day Improvements
1. Further improve computer logic regarding adjacent ships (currently, the computer can navigate adjacent ships ok, but once it reaches the end of an adjacent chain and sinks the last ship in the chain, it forgets about the other adjacent ships that it found along the way).
2. Add 2-player versus mode. The game flow already works if the hard-coded computer player is switched to a human; however, the following enhancements are needed:
    1. Add a UI toggle to set if P2 should be computer or human.
    2. Add a "pass device" screen to hide opponent ships until the device has been passed to the opponent.
